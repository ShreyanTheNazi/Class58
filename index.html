    <p>Born in Austria in 1889, Adolf Hitler rose to
        power in German politics as leader of the
        National Socialist German Workers Party, also
        known as the Nazi Party.
        
        Hitler was chancellor
        of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and served as
        dictator from 1934 to 1945.
        
      His policies
        precipitated World War II and the Holocaust.

     Hitler committed suicide with wife Eva Braun on
        April 30, 1945, in his Berlin bunker.</p>
